IMPORTANT: This project uses the odin freetype bindings found here: https://github.com/englerj/odin-freetype?tab=readme-ov-file.
There are installation instructions on their page, but you basically just git clone their repo into ODIN/shared, where ODIN is the 
directory where you have ODIN installed, and then to import the package use:
import "shared:freetype" 

This is not an exact copy of the tutorial (ex. it uses SDL2 instead of GLFW), but everything is functionally about the same. I did this over the course of a week to try out programming using Odin. 

I had no experience with Odin before this, so there are some organization/memory management things that could be improved upon. If I continue with Odin I might come back and improve on this project. I'm putting this on GitHub mainly for reference for myself.
